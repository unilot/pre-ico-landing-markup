              h4 Dear Gamers, Dear Investors,
              p Unilot appeared as a unique amalgam of bold vision, revolutionary ideas, social experiment, and elegant application of cutting edge technology. Unilot is driven by an important social mission in its core: to build the world's most transparent, secure, and diverse betting platform. Made possible by the advent of Blockchain, Unilot launches a truly universal arena to gambling, betting, and prognostication. It is there to leverage the players' abilities and creativity while providing the atmosphere of safety and integrity far beyond those found in modern gambling.
              p We believe that the house does not always have to win. That is why in Unilot, we decided not to have a House for our players to compete against. We believe that math doesn't lie and can make cheating impossible. That is why we offer our players a pure chance to wager against each other's odds, We believe that sharing is truly caring. Thus we offer freedom of choice and multiple second chances and consolation rounds to all members of our community. While we believe in respecting the laws of the land, we also believe in people's fundamental right to make their own judgement when to try their luck as well as enjoy the opportunity to create their own rules when making a bet.
              p Unilot may seem like a magical little playground that resides on your phone or computer screen, but it opens a door to the place, where the whole world comes together for a fun and engaging experience with odds never rigged unless they are occasionally stacked into players' favor.
              p We pledge to review any community's feedback and keep the records open for anyone to audit building trust and openness standards like never before.
              p Dive in, read about us, talk to us, play with us and have fun!

          p Unilot uses blockchain to run a decentralized universal gambling platform for players to bet, host, and in future create their own games ranging from pure chance lotteries, to poker tournaments, and prognostication-based totalizers. We are working to make Unilot available on the Web, iOS and Android and in multiple languages in addition to current English and Russian.
          p To facilitate the exchange, Unilot platform transacts in its own currency “Unilots” while accepting most cryptocurrencies and other legal means of tender in appropriate jurisdictions. The purpose of this White Paper is to demonstrate Unilot’s technology and solutions it offers, as well as demonstrate the mature business expertise behind the founding team’s vision.

          p With online gambling market projected to reach nearly $60B by 2020#[a(href="#footnote-intro" title="See footnote") #[sup.footnote-ref#ref-intro]], both the quickly-evolving regulatory landscape and criminal practices turn away consumers reducing their trust and peace of mind. Here at Unilot, we made it our strategic priority to successfully tackle regulatory limitations that vary drastically from one jurisdiction to another, and mitigate consumer mistrust.
          p To deal with regulations, games offered through Unilot will vary based on the player's geographic location. We are building an intelligent system capable of detecting which games to offer and which ones to lock. Furthermore, Unilot continues to secure licenses in various jurisdictions to expand its user-base.
          p Unilot leverages decentralized gaming on blockchain to effectively address consumer mistrust, featuring some core fair-play fundamentals:

            li Our goal is to reinvigorate online gambling with Ethereum blockchain, radically improving end-user experience through player-self-managed identification, absurdly low fees, and inviolable guarantee of instant pay on winnings.

          p Online gambling industry has been plagued by inability to tackle high tech cheating and lack of transparency. To name a few, 2008 and 2011 online poker scandals led to online gambling bans in some countries.
          p Though it was off to a rocky start, online gambling is well poised to become the gambling industry's fastest-growing sector, and accounts for 11% of the $385B of gambling profits posted in 2016. These numbers are only set to grow as regulations worldwide are loosening their stance toward online betting.
          p According to H2 Gambling Capital, total revenues in 2016 from online gambling posted staggering $44B with online betting responsible for nearly a half of the total amount#[a(href="#footnote-market" title="See footnote") #[sup.footnote-ref#ref-market]]. Market projections show this number to grow to $47.4 Billion USD in 2017 and over $60 billion by 2020.

Players may set their minimum ante, game type and invite others to participate. Games are by invite-only and otherwise remain invisible to global community.
              p Hosting functionality is what makes Unilot truly stand out from most online lotteries by creating a comprehensive platform for current and future peer-betting venues. Currently, players can host any of the available global games, like running their own poker tournament, setting out their own rules, minimum pot size, their own "host's cut". In the near future, using smart contracts and oracles, Unilot players should be able to create their own betting pools and totalizers.

          p For all available global games, Unilot retains a tiny fraction of game winnings and game antes where games have an an ante or entry fee. Unilot also retains a small percentage every time Unilots are exchanged; those proceeds are then distributed among Unilot token holders based on proof-of-stake mechanism.
          p For hosted games and white label games Unilot collects a setup fee or offers service level agreement to larger hosts. In certain instances, owners of hosted games and white label companies (the originators) when spinning off their own games may want to have Unilot owners (the backers) auction, loan, or put forth their own Unilots to fully or partially fund those hosted games. In exchange, the backers may receive additional revenues or incentives from the originators even if the backers don't end up playing that particular game.
          p Regardless of the arrangement, the fees Unilot retains in global games or as part of setup fees in white label and hosted games are seamless, transparent and not interrupting to the gaming process.

Unilot aims to market product placement opportunities and calculate advertising fees based on the audience's geographic and demographic parameters.
              p Faithful to its mission to further fairness and common benefit, Unilot intends to not only run commercial product placements, but also provide a centerstage for philanthropic causes, including fundraisers for meaningful social causes.

              p Unilot recognizes the value and opportunity of engaging global audiences and making play easy and fun. Being able to accept conventional currencies is a major part of this solution, as many people worldwide are still poorly familiar with concept of cryptocurrencies. Aiming to encourage the use of its platform for individual betting and create a strong global and diverse presence, Unilot currently develops the feature that allows accepting funds in local currencies placed on physical and digital gift cards. Such gift cards can be sold throughout small retail places and used by their recipients as conventional lottery tickets.

              p Use of smart contracts on Ethereum network significantly simplifies running the games, their integrity, and inviolability of their outcome. Some basic examples of those Smart Contracts can run ladders in tournaments or sets of individual table rules like seat assignments, escrowing funds, and distribution of payouts.

              p Part of our commitment to providing quality gaming network, includes embedding of solutions like uPort#[a(href="#footnote-tech" title="See footnote") #[sup.footnote-ref#ref-tech]] or similar options as they become available. We very well know that a good game should not be interrupted by bots, fake accounts, and other unwanted spam.

              p Unilot uses Mental Poker algorithm that produces a consensus through a Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus Mechanism for games that require shuffling. Simultaneously, peer-to-peer messaging ensures game's critical-and-sufficient synchronization across multiple mobile clients. For all in-game activity, Unilot runs a time-series log stored on IPFS for both compliance and technical purposes.

          p Truthful to our mission, we design Unilot to become a truly global gambling and betting platform transcending geographic and demographic barriers to cater a unique personalized experience to every player. The use of Ethereum network and smart contracts yields a transparent record of game results data, which we deliberately keep open for public to review and analyze.
          p Parallel to data produced on main stack, we are also building Unilot Artificial Intelligence solution to observe systems performance and improve user experience. AI's mission is to help users feel informed and empowered with best relevant data, like gaming odds, curated interpretation of gaming trends, or provide assistant functions to UI.

          p All Unilot global or hosted games can be run on Unilot mobile client, specifically designed to handle all components of peer-to-peer communication from initiating and joining games to performing the required blockchain actions, like using a Mental Poker protocol for cards shuffling. Unilot mobile client also runs a so-called light wallet to facilitate escrow, ensure instant payout on winnings, and keep game ante and wins separate from player's stash. In subsequent releases, light wallet would also offer instant conversion feature to other cryptocurrencies from Unilots.
          p Currently, the mobile client is built for iOS and Android only, and offers smart region selection and localization.
